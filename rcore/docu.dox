/*! @page flippers Flippers - Feature Toggles
Flippers are feature toggles that can be used to enable certain development features at runtime.
Features are enabled by listing them separated with colons in the environment variable #$RAPICORN_FLIPPER.
See Rapicorn::rapicorn_flipper_check() to check for flipper settings in #$RAPICORN_FLIPPER, and
refer to Rapicorn::envkey_flipper_check() to check for flipper settings generically.

/** Environment variable for feature toggles.
 * The #$RAPICORN_FLIPPER environment variable may contain a colon separated list of features that
 * can enable additional runtime behaviour. This is especially useful to allow rolling releases
 * while some features are still under development, for further details, see @Wikipedia{Feature toggle}.
 * A summary about feature toggles used by Rapicorn is provided on the page @ref flippers.

/** Environment variable for unit tests.
 * The #$RAPICORN_TEST environment variable may contain a colon separated list of flags that
 * are used during test runs. In particular:
 * - @c test-verbose - Execute test cases with verbose message generation.
 * - @c test-readout - Execute only data driven test cases to verify readouts.
 * - @c test-slow - Execute only test cases excercising slow code paths or loops.
 * .
 * See also Rapicorn::init_core() and Rapicorn::init_core_test().

/** Environment variable for debugging.
 * The #$RAPICORN_DEBUG environment variable may contain a colon separated list of options that

/** Build system macro definition of compiler CWD.
 * To improve source file location information in debugging and error messages,
 * RAPICORN_PRETTY_FILE is provided (aliased to __PRETTY_FILE__ if RAPICORN_CONVENIENCE is
 * enabled). This macro provides a full path variant of __FILE__, which works by
 * by prefixing __FILE__ with __FILE_DIR__ which should be defined to the
 * compiler CWD during compilation.
 * The best way to provide this information is as follows: <pre>
 * <b>Makefile.am:</b>
 * DEFS += @@DEFINE__FILE_DIR__@@
 * <b>configure.ac:</b>
 * if echo $VERSION | grep -iq devel ; then
 *   DEFINE__FILE_DIR__='-D__FILE_DIR__=\"${abs_srcdir}\"'
 * else
 *   DEFINE__FILE_DIR__='-D__FILE_DIR__=\"$PROJECT_NAME/${subdir}\"'
 * fi
 * AC_SUBST(DEFINE__FILE_DIR__)
 * </pre>
 * The above configure code special cases development versions allowing absolute path matching as
 * __FILE_DIR__/__FILE__:__LINE__ for debugging messages.
 * During stable versions $PROJECT_NAME/__FILE__ provides a clue about the originating
 * component for failure messages.
