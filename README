General Information
===================

This is a development version of Rapicorn.
Rapicorn is targeted at replacing GnomeCanvas in terms of functionality,
and to extend beyond that functionality as deemed reasonable.
Cairo is planned to be used for rendering tasks, and Pango is intended to be
used for text rendering until cairo implementes text rendering sufficiently.

In order to build release tarballs, you need a recent version of pango.
To be able to use recent development versions, currently libpixman
and libcairo are included in the tarball, so no extra such libraries are
required.
The sources for required packages can be found at:

Pango-1.8:
	ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.6/
