The Rapicorn Toolkit
====================

Rapicorn is a toolkit for rapid development of user interfaces in C++ and
Python. The user interface (UI) is designed in a declarative markup language
and is connected to the programming logic using data bindings and commands.

New project releases can be found at the project website:
    http://rapicorn.org

At the moment, Rapicorn is in the "prototype" phase so some features are
still under heavy development. You can refer to the roadmap for details:

Building and Installation
=========================

Rapicorn has been successfully build under 32bit, 64bit and Ubuntu versions
13.10, 14.04 and 14.10. A number of dependency packages need to be installed:

    apt-get install libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev intltool python2.7-dev \
      libxml2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libreadline6-dev Xvfb x11-xserver-utils

Building and testing a build is accomplished as follows:

    ./configure && make -j`nproc` && make install
    make -j`nproc` check installcheck

Building the Rapicorn git repository uses autogen.sh instead of configure and
needs additional packages:
    autoconf libtool automake intltool dot doxygen bison flex
