Mon Jul 10 02:18:18 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/testitem.hh, rapicorn/testitem.cc: implemented a test item
	that can be used to assert various layout properties like sizing and
	positioning.

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: define test-item.

	* tests/testitems.cc, tests/testitems.xml: implemented item test 
	program. added checks for alignment padding and Item::width and
	Item::height properties.

Sat Jul  8 20:55:12 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/table.cc, rapicorn/tableimpl.hh: changed shrinking logic so
	we start shrinking columns/rows in the center of a table. also, if not
	enough shrinkable columns could be found, shrink all columns/rows by
	an amount proportional to their size, starting from the center.
	this makes resizes beyond the requisition feel much more natural, since
	we now make the best effort to avoid shrinking artefacts and we do our
	best to provide important controls at window/table edges (like menubars
	or buttons).

Sat Jul  8 18:07:30 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: fixed buttons to espand their children.
	set width-from-height/height-from-width size policies for slider
	arrows to enforce square allocations for arrow buttons.

	* rapicorn/paintgadgets.hh, rapicorn/paintgadgets.cc:
	added size_policy() property to arrows to allow width-from-height and
	vice versa sizing policies.

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/itemimpl.hh, rapicorn/item.cc:

	* rapicorn/root.hh, rapicorn/rootimpl.hh, rapicorn/root.cc:
	changed resizing logic to allow requisition tuning during allocation,
	at least for the first 3 size allocations (basically, this allowes
	flexible resizing algorithms which to converge from an initially unstable
	to a stable state later on, similar to simulated annealing).
	added logic to dispatch WIN_DELETE events.

	* rapicorn/enumdefs.hh: added SizePolicyType. 

	* rapicorn/events.cc: added WIN_DELETE event.

	compressed zintern block from it.

	* tests/Makefile.am:

	* rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: refined backing store logic to take display
	settings into account. refined cancellation of incremental blit requests.
	simplified and slightly fixed rapicorn_viewport_event_context().
	introduced rapicorn_viewport_change_visibility() for all visibility changes.
	listen to toplevel visibility-notify events. honoured more 
	GDK_VISIBILITY_FULLY_OBSCURED, e.g. on toplevel unmap.
	ignore GDK_DELETE events.
	introduced rapicorn_init_with_foreign_gtk().

	* rapicorn/utilities.cc: make sure to initialize birnet with rapicorn.

	to display a Root item on physical screend.

	* examples/tour.cc: removed all gtk specific glue.

	reference count and floating state. derived types should use 
	BIRNET_DISABLE_CLASS_COPY() to prevent stack allocation of instances.
