@section contributors Welcoming Contributors

As a free software project, the Rapicorn project is inviting everyone to participate with ideas, code,
wiki contributions, artwork, documentation or other means.

This part of the manual will cover aspects helping developers to work with the internals of the toolkit.

@section buildarch Build Architecture

There are several parts in Rapicorn useful to learn about to navigate through its source code.

Build pieces:
- @c aidacc/ : The IDL used to compile the API definitions and generate the language bindings.
- @c librapicorn.so : The actual Rapicorn library, written in C++11, consisting of:
  - @c rcore/ : Rapicorn core functions, routines to work with strings, IO, configuration and IPC.
  - @c ui/ : This directory contains the IDL API and the collection of user interface elements, the UI factory and data bindings provided by Rapicorn.
- @c tools/rapidrun : A sample executable that loads and displays Rapciorn UI declarations. This tool is also used for unit testing.
- @c res/ : The collection of various resources, e.g. icons that are built into @c librapicorn.so.
